#This repository has all the stuff I do at work and this cool weather application. 
#Applications I work on at work are private.
#1. SC-QUEUE ( Cool Angular Laravel Application that hits JIRA API's)
#2. MERF - ( Fancy Angular JS form for Syracuse University Chancellor)
#3. ID-UPLOAD - ( I added a responsive BootStrap layout)
#4. BlackBoard-addUsers plugin (Just started working on it. Too much JSP)
